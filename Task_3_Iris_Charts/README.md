Task 3: Visualization using Histogram & Bar Chart 📊

 ✅ Objective:
Create visualizations using a histogram and a bar chart to understand the distribution and category counts in the Iris dataset.

 📁 Files:
- Task3_Iris_Histogram.ipynb – Python code to generate both charts
- iris_histogram.png – Image of Sepal Length histogram
- 

 📊 Charts:
1. Histogram – Distribution of Sepal Length (`SepalLengthCm`)
2. Bar Chart – Count of each flower species (`Species`)

🔧 Libraries Used:
- pandas
- matplotlib
 📝 Conclusion:

Through this task, I explored basic data visualization techniques to understand the distribution of numerical features using histograms, and categorical counts using bar charts.

These charts help in:
- Detecting skewness in data
- Understanding class imbalance
- Gaining insights quickly before modeling

This task enhanced my skills in data exploration, visualization, and working with real-world datasets using Python and Matplotlib.
